Welcome to the calhacks5.0 wiki! This project uses the Google Cloud AutoML Vision API to train over 4000 images of benign and malignant cancer cells using deep learning. The confusion matrix for the trained images can be seen in the results.pdf file. After training the data, we developed a simple front end framework that allows a user to upload an image to be classified. AutoML then analyzes the image on the backend and predicts whether the cells are "benign" or "malignant" using a convolutional neural network. The confidence level of the prediction is reported along with its classification. The UI can be demoed locally by running the calhacks.py. Currently, the project must be demoed as it requires authentication to use our Google Cloud Storage account. In the future, we plan to create an application of the product that can be used globally instead of being constrained to a local computer. A handful of test images have been provided with the repository to use with the interface. The results.pdf file shows where some of the images were obtained from, verifying that the accuracy and integrity of the algorithm. The BreakHist_Dataset was obtained from Kaggle.com and used to train the model.
